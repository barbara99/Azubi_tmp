# üîç TERM DEPOSIT SUBSCRIPTION PREDICTION

**Azubi Africa - Talent Mobility Program Assessment**
*By Barbara Asiamah*

---

## üìå PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project was developed as part of the **Azubi Africa Talent Mobility Program**. The objective is to build a predictive machine learning solution that determines whether a client will subscribe to a **term deposit product** based on information gathered during direct marketing campaigns by a bank.

The final product includes a deployed **interactive Streamlit app** that allows users to input various client attributes and receive a real-time prediction on the likelihood of subscription.

---

## üß† PROBLEM STATEMENT

The marketing team of a financial institution wants to optimize their campaigns by targeting clients who are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. With thousands of clients contacted across various campaigns, it‚Äôs essential to use past data to guide future marketing efforts.

As a data analyst, my task was to:

* Explore the dataset and uncover useful trends.
* Build a model that predicts whether a client will subscribe to the term deposit (`y = yes` or `no`).
* Deploy the model through a web interface for easy usability by non-technical users.

| TMP\_1   | Client Term Deposit Prediction | Build and deploy an ML model to predict client subscription behavior |

---

## ‚úÖ TASK BREAKDOWN

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I started with a comprehensive review of the dataset, which included:

* Identifying **missing values** (e.g., `unknown` entries in categorical features),
* Analyzing **distribution of categorical and numeric variables**,
* Assessing **correlations** and **target imbalance**,
* Investigating trends in subscription behavior.

### 2. Feature Engineering

* Encoded categorical variables using **one-hot encoding**,
* Created additional features like `campaign_diff`,
* Evaluated **feature importance** using Random Forest.

### 3. Model Development

* Trained multiple models including:

  * **Random Forest** (final model),
  * Logistic Regression,
  * XGBoost.
* Random Forest was selected for its overall balance in accuracy and interpretability.

### 4. Model Evaluation

* Evaluated with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**,
* Handled **class imbalance** using SMOTE and threshold adjustments,
* Final model reached \~88% accuracy with a reasonable balance of precision and recall.

### 5. Deployment

* The model was deployed using **Streamlit**, offering a clean, interactive interface for predictions.

## üìÅ DATA OVERVIEW

The data used for this project originates from direct marketing efforts conducted via phone calls. More than one contact per client is possible.

## üîç EVALUATION METRICS

| Metric    | Score                   |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| Accuracy  | 88%                     |
| Precision | Moderate                |
| Recall    | Lower on positive class |
| F1 Score  | Balanced across models  |

Special care was taken to address **class imbalance**, particularly since subscriptions (`y = yes`) were relatively rare in the dataset.

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

* Clients contacted during **certain months** like March or September had higher conversion rates.
* **Contact method** (e.g., cellular vs telephone) had an effect on subscription likelihood.
* Features such as `age`, `euribor3m`, and `campaign` were among the **top predictors**.
